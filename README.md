# pyfck - python using only 8 characters: exc'%=()

This repo outlines a method of encoding any python script using only the following 8 characters:

`e x c ' % = ( )`


## History of fuck

Way back in 1993, Urban MÃ¼ller created the esoteric programming language [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck),
which is a turing complete (but essentially unreadable) programming language that can be written with only 6 characters (`+-<>[]`).

Some time later in 2009, Yosuke Hasegawa created what would eventually become [JSFuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSFuck), a way of writing valid JavaScript code using only 18 characters.
Over the next year, this would be reduced down to just 6 characters (`[]()!+`). I'm pretty sure this was actually my first exposure to any kind of esoteric programming when I started learning to program in JS around 2015.

This would inevitably inspire the repo [pyfuck](https://github.com/wanqizhu/pyfuck), which in 2017 would get python3 down to only 13 characters (`[(+travels')]`).
In 2022, a [fork of pyfuck](https://github.com/Samdaaman/pyfuck) reduced the python3 limit down to just 9 characters (`exc'=()%+`).

Technically, the pyfuck fork was inspired by a [stackexchange post](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/110677) from early 2017 (before the original pyfuck repo)
that outlined how to write python3 using the same 9 characters, so really the first person was some random stackoverflow codegolfer.
That post was itself a continuation of a post that got python2 down to just 7 chracters, although python2 is much more forgiving than python3 with the exclusion of brackets (2 whole chracters!),
so this is to be expected.

Now in 2023, for some reason I wasted half a day and managed to to remove one more chracter from the 9 character python3 pyfuck limit.
Introducing pyfuk!
Valid python3 code using only 8 characters (`exc'%=()`).
